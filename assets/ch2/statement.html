    <h1>JStgp:</h1>
    <p>A copilation unit contains a set of executable statements.  In Web browsers each script tag delivers a complication unit that is compiled and immudiatly executed.  Lacking a linker, JavaScript throws them all together in a common global namespace.  When used inside of a function, the var statement defines the function's private variables.</p>
    <p>The switch, while, for and do statements are allowed to have an optional label prefix that interacts with the break and continue statements (see statement.js).</p>
